# Pig Latin Exercise

Pig Latin Converter app using Angular 2.

This converter will be required to:
•	Accept English Words (and or sentences)
•	Convert the words entered into Pig Latin
•	Output the Pig Latin version of the Word

You are optionally required to:
•	Keep a track of the history of the last 10 words/sentences and also display these
The app can also incorporate any feature of modern frontend development, e.g. Css PreProcessors, Build tools such as Grunt/Gulp, ES5+.
You should not use any existing library or algorithm which provide functionality for Pig Latin Conversion.
You can include third party libraries to do things like nicely output alerts, or CSS frameworks like Bootstrap/Foundation etc. if desired, to make the app feel more feature rich.
